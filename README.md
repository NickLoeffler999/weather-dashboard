# weather-dashboard
This is a simple web application that will provide information about the weather in a city of the user's choice.

## Description

This project was designed so that the user can see the current weather or a 5 day forecast of a specific city. It's a fully functional tool that anyone can use to make planning their day or week an easy task instead of getting bummed out by some rain, snow, or getting stuck in some otherwise unfortunate weather conditions.
This website uses fully functional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to perform. When the user inputs a city name into the text area,and clicks the search button or hits enter, they will be shown the current wether and a 5 day forecast. This application was extremely difficult for me to get through, but it was a huge help on developing my Web Development skills as a whole. Using API's

## Installation

This web application does not require any installation, just click the link and go!

## Usage

The way to use this application is to type a city name into the search bar underneath "Search for a city:", and view the data it displays, which will be current weather conditions of the chosen city as well as a 5 day forecast. When the page is refreshed, the names of the cities that were searched will be displayed below the search bar for future reference too, so you can easily access your favorite cities! This data will be stored locally which you can access with Chrome Dev Tools, so you can view the cities that were searched. This web app was designed for the use of all people, as it is fairly straightforward in how to use it. The Weather Dashboard can be used whenever and wherever, and is a handy tool to have when traveling, doing activities, or planning a trip. 


## Credits

I used the API from openweathermap.org to get my information about the weather. Using this API was my first time outside of practice, and it helped me build on the fundamentals as to how it works because their documentation is thorough.
